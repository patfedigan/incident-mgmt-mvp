## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account
2. **Repository**: The incident management code should be in a GitHub repository
3. **Node.js**: For building the project locally (optional)

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Build the Project

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd incident-mgmt-ui

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages

1. **Go to Repository Settings**:
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings" tab

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/docs" folder
   - Click "Save"

3. **Alternative: Deploy from Actions** (Recommended):
   - Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file
   - Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy automatically

### Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
        cache-dependency-path: incident-mgmt-ui/package-lock.json
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd incident-mgmt-ui
        npm ci
        
    - name: Build project
      run: |
        cd incident-mgmt-ui
        npm run build
        
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: ./incident-mgmt-ui/build
```

### Step 4: Configure Repository Settings

1. **Set GitHub Pages Source**:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "gh-pages" (created by the action)
   - Folder: "/ (root)"

2. **Enable Actions**:
   - Go to Settings → Actions → General
   - Ensure "Allow all actions and reusable workflows" is selected

## 🎮 Testing the Deployment

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test the build locally
cd incident-mgmt-ui
npm run build
npx serve -s build
```

### GitHub Pages Testing
1. **Wait for Deployment**: GitHub Actions will build and deploy automatically
2. **Check Status**: Go to Actions tab to monitor deployment progress
3. **Visit Site**: Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/incident-mgmt-mvp/`

## 🔍 Demo Features to Test

### 1. AI Summarization
- Click "🤖 Summarize with AI" on any incident
- Watch the streaming animation with dots
- See progressive text building
- Observe contextual summary generation

### 2. Incident Management
- Create new incidents with the form
- Edit existing incidents
- View incident details and comments
- Test responsive design on mobile

### 3. Mock Data Features
- Rich sample incidents with realistic scenarios
- Comments and status updates
- Priority and status badges
- Date formatting and metadata

## 🛠️ Customization Options

### Environment Detection
The app automatically detects GitHub Pages environment:
```javascript
const isGitHubPages = window.location.hostname === 'patfedigan.github.io' || 
                     window.location.hostname.includes('github.io');
```

### Mock Data Enhancement
- Add more sample incidents in `IncidentList.js`
- Enhance AI summary generation logic
- Add more realistic comment scenarios

### Styling Customization
- Modify colors and themes in CSS files
- Add custom animations and transitions
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**:
   ```bash
   # Check Node.js version
   node --version
   
   # Clear npm cache
   npm cache clean --force
   
   # Reinstall dependencies
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **GitHub Pages Not Updating**:
   - Check Actions tab for deployment status
   - Verify branch and folder settings
   - Clear browser cache and hard refresh

3. **CORS Errors**:
   - GitHub Pages demo uses mock data only
   - No backend API calls are made
   - All functionality is client-side

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Console**: Open browser dev tools for errors
2. **Verify Build**: Ensure `npm run build` completes successfully
3. **Check Actions**: Monitor GitHub Actions deployment logs
4. **Test Locally**: Use `npx serve -s build` to test locally first

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

The demo is fully responsive and optimized for:
- **Desktop**: Full feature set with hover effects
- **Tablet**: Adaptive layout with touch-friendly buttons
- **Mobile**: Optimized for small screens with simplified interactions

## 🎨 Demo Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Local Storage**: Persist user-created incidents
2. **Export Features**: Download incident reports
3. **Search/Filter**: Add incident filtering capabilities
4. **Dark Mode**: Add theme switching
5. **Animations**: Enhanced loading and transition effects

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Code Splitting**: Lazy load components
2. **Image Optimization**: Compress and optimize assets
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Monitor bundle size
4. **Caching**: Implement service worker for offline support
